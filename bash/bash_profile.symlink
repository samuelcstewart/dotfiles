# Load the shell dotfiles, and then some:
# * ~/.path can be used to extend `$PATH`.
# * ~/.extra can be used for other settings you donâ€™t want to commit.

# Login shells call bash_profile, non-login shells call bashrc. OSX's
# Terminal.app runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window
# calling bash_profile. Source bashrc from bash_profile for portability.
